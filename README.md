# Growtopia_ItemsDatReader
Deserializer for items.dat (Growtopia)

If you use this for your own purposes, then make sure to credit us!  Read the license in the LICENSE file.  Thanks!

# USAGE
To use, put your items.dat in the folder containing the `*.py` file, then run it. This will decompress the items.dat (with new 3.021 update). After you do so, build the C# project and drag the decompressed items.dat to the extractor.
